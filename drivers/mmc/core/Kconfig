config MMC_CLKGATE
	bool "MMC host clock gating"
	help
	  This will attempt to aggressively gate the clock to the MMC card.
	  This is done to save power due to gating off the logic and bus
	  noise when the MMC card is not in use. Your host driver has to
	  support handling this in order for it to be of any use.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_EMBEDDED_SDIO
	boolean "MMC embedded SDIO device support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, support will be added for embedded SDIO
	  devices which do not contain the necessary enumeration
	  support in hardware to be properly detected.

config MMC_PARANOID_SD_INIT
	bool "Enable paranoid SD card initialization (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will be extra paranoid
	  about re-trying SD init requests. This can be a useful
	  work-around for buggy controllers and hardware. Enable
	  if you are experiencing issues with SD detection.

config ASUS_GET_EMMC_TOTAL_SIZE
	bool "Enable ASUS_GET_EMMC_TOTAL_SIZE"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will be extra paranoid
	  about re-trying SD init requests. This can be a useful
	  work-around for buggy controllers and hardware. Enable
	  if you are experiencing issues with SD detection.
